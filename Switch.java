            Sometimes you need to execute a specific
            piece of code depending on the result
            of a expression. When the expression is boolean
            either is true or false you can use if/else statement. 
            What about if you have more outcomes? for example
            numbers 1, 2 or 3. Yes you can use:
                if(number==1){
                    //code 1
                }else if(number==2){
                    //code 2
                }else if(number==3){
                    //code 3
                }else{
                    //default code in case number no matches 1,2 or 3
                }
            good but... if my options are numbers from 1 to 10?            
            or something
        choose from a set
            of choices and executed a code dependi
            Let's supose you need to choose  set of conditions
            and just one of them is going to be true
            and you want a specific instruction
            in case the follow:
                if(**condition 1**){
                    //code 1
                }else if(**condition 2**){
                    //code 2
                }else if(**condition 3**){
                    //code 3
                  .
                  .
                  .
                }else if(**condition N**){
                    //code N
                }else{
                    //code in case none condition was true
                }
            This normally happens when you have some conditions
            and you
